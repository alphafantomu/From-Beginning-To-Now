# From-Beginning-To-Now
This repository will attempt to include all the code I've ever worked on from as far as I can.

## Notice
Due to fear of dangerous code that is probably somewhere on my computer that I coded, there will be some tags attached to some of the files.
### Places
Unnamed - Means that the name displayed is the actual original name of the script.

Filtered - Means that the place content was modified, most likely some content was removed.

### Scripts
Unnamed - Means that the name displayed is the actual original name of the script.

Filtered - Means that the code content was modified, most likely removal of past databases and apis that are no longer active.

Modified - Code was not made from scratch and was instead modified, most likely used as theoretical testing purposes or personal use.

Team - Code was being worked on by more than one person, most likely a team rather than a community.

# From-Beginning-To-Now
This repository will attempt to include all the code I've ever worked on from as far as I can.

## Notice
Due to fear of dangerous code that is probably somewhere on my computer that I coded, there will be some tags attached to some of the files.
### Places
Unnamed - Means that the name displayed is the actual original name of the script.

Filtered - Means that the place content was modified, most likely some content was removed.

Dead - Means that the place cannot be opened due to the fact that I: Tried to generate so many parts the place takes an undefined amount of time to load, tried to break the engine and did, too much data being loaded at once causes the program to crash or computer not strong enough to handle the file.

### Scripts
Unnamed - Means that the name displayed is the actual original name of the script.

Filtered - Means that the code content was modified, most likely removal of past databases and apis that are no longer active.

Modified - Code was not made from scratch and was instead modified, most likely used as theoretical testing purposes or personal use.

Team - Code was being worked on by more than one person, most likely a team rather than a community.

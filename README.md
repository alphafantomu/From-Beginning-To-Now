# From-Beginning-To-Now
This repository will attempt to include all the code I've ever worked on from as far as I can.

## Notice
Due to fear of dangerous code that is probably somewhere on my computer that I coded, there will be some tags attached to some of the files.
### Places
Unnamed - Means that the name displayed is the actual original name of the script.

Filtered - Means that the place content was modified, most likely some content was removed.

Dead - Means that the place cannot be opened due to the fact that I: Tried to generate so many parts the place takes an undefined amount of time to load, tried to break the engine and did, too much data being loaded at once causes the program to crash or computer not strong enough to handle the file.

### Scripts
Unnamed - Means that the name displayed is the actual original name of the script.

Filtered - Means that the code content was modified, most likely removal of past databases and apis that are no longer active.

Modified - Code was not made from scratch and was instead modified, most likely used as theoretical testing purposes or personal use.

Team - Code was being worked on by more than one person, most likely a team rather than a community.

[Packy Plugin.rbxl](https://github.com/alphafantomu/From-Beginning-To-Now/blob/master/RBXL%20Places/Packy%20Plugin.rbxl) | None | Sunday, July 15, 2018 5:01:10 PM | According to the repository the plugin was replicated on, "Packy is a Roblox Studio package manager. It is an alternative to Roblox's poor asset management system and offers lots of functionality and features to both developers and consumers alike. It is in development & hosted by https://bloxreport.com/code developers. It is also open-source so anyone and everyone can step in to see, modify, and even enhance our package fetcher.". Note this is no longer being updated by me and the website is inactive. Here's a link to it if you'd like to check it out if you can't access the file very well. https://github.com/alphafantomu/rbxpacky

[asdasdasdsada.rbxl](https://github.com/alphafantomu/From-Beginning-To-Now/blob/master/RBXL%20Places/asdasdasdsada.rbxl) | Unnamed | Monday, February 19, 2018, 9:17:58 PM | This place consists of a bunch of random code because super unorganized on where my code goes. This place includes code for: Function of uploading text files and view them raw using [Hastebin](https://hastebin.com)'s API. HTML Source stripper for all the object classes, properties, functions, yield functions, enumerations and the class system in the engine supplied by [Anaminus's API Reference](https://anaminus.github.io/api/), to be compressed into a database encoded in JSON. A client-sided script that was intentionally going to be a full-fledged project but was abandoned due to lack of motivation. Was supposed to be an Eclipsis multi-purpose exploit/hack/cheat, but never was stretched out. Another piece of code located in ServerStorage, it's an error-catching evaluated script that overrided Roblox's coding environment and rewritten yield calling and require methods to support instances with blank source strings and files across the web that are readable. This was most likely supposed to used as a multi-purpose hack/exploit/cheat for variety of games on Roblox, also has a whitelist system that checks the current logged in user in the browser through roblox's api. Lastly in Workspace, this is an admin script used to have control over other players in-game, specifically Script Builder games. Most of the code is in camel case, while I typically code pascal case this admin script was worked on by me and my partner, he coded camel case. Script has an hierachy class-based system with rankings, tabs that rotate the player, commands system, sandbox code to be run within the engine in-game, connection to http and able to modify other clients.

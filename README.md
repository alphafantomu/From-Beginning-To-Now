# From-Beginning-To-Now
This repository will include all the rbx place files, all my scripts converted to a .lua format, and possibly will include some .html, .css, .js, .json files etc. This will likely miss some of my projects that either got obsolete from existence or has been lost through a website long ago (such as Stypi). 

## Notice
Due to fear of dangerous code that is probably somewhere on my computer that I coded, there will be some tags attached to some of the files.
### Places
Unnamed - Means that the name displayed is the actual original name of the script.

Filtered - Means that the place content was modified, most likely some content was removed.

### Scripts
Unnamed - Means that the name displayed is the actual original name of the script.

Filtered - Means that the code content was modified, most likely removal of past databases and apis that are no longer active.

Modified - Code was not made from scratch and was instead modified, most likely used as theoretical testing purposes or personal use.

Team - Code was being worked on by more than one person, most likely a team rather than a community.

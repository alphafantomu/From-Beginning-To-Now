# From-Beginning-To-Now
This repository will attempt to include all the code I've ever worked on from as far as I can.

## Notice
Due to fear of dangerous code that is probably somewhere on my computer that I coded, there will be some tags attached to some of the files.
### Places
Unnamed - Means that the name displayed is the actual original name of the script.

Filtered - Means that the place content was modified, most likely some content was removed.

Dead - Means that the place cannot be opened due to the fact that I: Tried to generate so many parts the place takes an undefined amount of time to load, tried to break the engine and did, too much data being loaded at once causes the program to crash or computer not strong enough to handle the file.

### Scripts
Unnamed - Means that the name displayed is the actual original name of the script.

Filtered - Means that the code content was modified, most likely removal of past databases and apis that are no longer active.

Modified - Code was not made from scratch and was instead modified, most likely used as theoretical testing purposes or personal use.

Team - Code was being worked on by more than one person, most likely a team rather than a community.

[aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.rbxl](https://github.com/alphafantomu/From-Beginning-To-Now/blob/master/RBXL%20Places/aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.rbxl) | Unnamed, Dead | Tuesday, June 19, 2018 3:55:09 PM | Honestly, for some reason I had no idea why I can't open the place, can't extract code from the place but may have been used for 3D Modeling.

[Packy Plugin.rbxl](https://github.com/alphafantomu/From-Beginning-To-Now/blob/master/RBXL%20Places/Packy%20Plugin.rbxl) | None | Sunday, July 15, 2018 5:01:10 PM | According to the repository the plugin was replicated on, "Packy is a Roblox Studio package manager. It is an alternative to Roblox's poor asset management system and offers lots of functionality and features to both developers and consumers alike. It is in development & hosted by https://bloxreport.com/code developers. It is also open-source so anyone and everyone can step in to see, modify, and even enhance our package fetcher.". Note this is no longer being updated by me and the website is inactive. Here's a link to it if you'd like to check it out if you can't access the file very well. https://github.com/alphafantomu/rbxpacky

[asdasdasdsada.rbxl](https://github.com/alphafantomu/From-Beginning-To-Now/blob/master/RBXL%20Places/asdasdasdsada.rbxl) | Unnamed | Monday, February 19, 2018, 9:17:58 PM | This place consists of a bunch of random code because super unorganized on where my code goes. This place includes code for: Function of uploading text files and view them raw using [Hastebin](https://hastebin.com)'s API. HTML Source stripper for all the object classes, properties, functions, yield functions, enumerations and the class system in the engine supplied by [Anaminus's API Reference](https://anaminus.github.io/api/), to be compressed into a database encoded in JSON. A client-sided script that was intentionally going to be a full-fledged project but was abandoned due to lack of motivation. Was supposed to be an Eclipsis multi-purpose exploit/hack/cheat, but never was stretched out. Another piece of code located in ServerStorage, it's an error-catching evaluated script that overrided Roblox's coding environment and rewritten yield calling and require methods to support instances with blank source strings and files across the web that are readable. This was most likely supposed to used as a multi-purpose hack/exploit/cheat for variety of games on Roblox, also has a whitelist system that checks the current logged in user in the browser through roblox's api. Lastly in Workspace, this is an admin script used to have control over other players in-game, specifically Script Builder games. Most of the code is in camel case, while I typically code pascal case this admin script was worked on by me and my partner, he coded camel case. Script has an hierachy class-based system with rankings, tabs that rotate the player, commands system, sandbox code to be run within the engine in-game, connection to http and able to modify other clients.

[AutoScriptSave.rbxl](https://github.com/alphafantomu/From-Beginning-To-Now/blob/master/RBXL%20Places/AutoScriptSave.rbxl) | Unnamed | Saturday, March 24, 2018, 5:22:23 PM | This is similar to the one above, it's a compilation of random coding projects that haven't been finished. This includes a client-script that automatically adjusts the distance of a line between two points, the points are able to be moved around and the line updates moves up to the amount of frames the program is running on, pretty neat, was actually planning to make it a module and use it to create real-time graph UIs based on gathered data. The code actually hasn't been updated for client-sided scripts, so running it in game will not correctly work. The gif below shows the line updating it's size and position every frame. There are two in-complete plugin scripts that were originally used to autosave. Specifically, my friend said that Roblox studio kept crashing on him and always lost all of his work, so I planned to design a plugin for him to automatically save all the scripts in the game into a webserver so that his code will be saved, however the project is incomplete. Also very blank-ish script that was originally intended to recreate LuaC functions inside Lua in-order to create a secondary lua interpreter inside lua in-order to bypass restrictions on engine coding. The autosave script also had an external support since there are script permissions within the engine, so this extension basically made it so that you'll be able to convert an instance back into XML data near perfectly and upload it to your inventory automatically, XML to Instance uses a json-compiled database of properties and instances. Lastly, we have a string to ascii encoder and decoder, simple enough turn a string into a string of bytes. Lastly I created my own numerical encryption using algebra 2 knowledge and properties of character bytes, encryption and decryption successful but there are round-off errors since it was used by a mathematical formula to be encrypted.

[ImageToPixel.rbxl](https://github.com/alphafantomu/From-Beginning-To-Now/blob/master/RBXL%20Places/ImageToPixel.rbxl) | None | Saturday, March 24, 2018, 5:22:23 PM | Quite small, tried to understand how images source data works with no outside knowledge, ended up converting the code to ascii bytes, back, conversions, in-order for it to get to an RGB format in pixels. Image showed to be a box with lines of colors. Other script is basically a source encryption with no key that loads through a Lua VM.

[FrameChangeTest.rbxl](https://github.com/alphafantomu/From-Beginning-To-Now/blob/master/RBXL%20Places/FrameChangeTest.rbxl) | None | Sunday, July 15, 2018, 6:57:18 PM | This place was used to find someway to thread the changing of colors to simulate changing frames by changing the rgb to ones of the next frame, tried making every pixel of a sample image a random color to test coloring speed. Sample image used was an image of Meliodas's Lostvayne weapon converted to pixels into the game.

[BaseplateIMGTEST.rbxl](https://github.com/alphafantomu/From-Beginning-To-Now/blob/master/RBXL%20Places/BaseplateIMGTEST.rbxl) | Dead | Tuesday, June 19, 2018 7:18:21 AM | The place literally was unable to load once I opened it, no idea what kind of content but I assume I tried to load an image clear 500,000 pixels or more into seperate instances, the engine apparently can't handle that, oof.

[BaseplateTETEtETETE](https://github.com/alphafantomu/From-Beginning-To-Now/blob/master/RBXL%20Places/BaseplateTETEtETETE_Modified.rbxl) | Filtered , Unnamed | Friday, June 22, 2018, 10:43:46 PM | Place used as a workspace of a project intended as a cheat script for a game. UI is inspired by Barry Allen's new tech suit after returning from the Speed Force.

[ImageToPixel.rbxl](https://github.com/alphafantomu/From-Beginning-To-Now/blob/master/RBXL%20Places/ImageToPixel.rbxl) | Unnamed | Wednesday, April 11, 2018, 12:52:05 PM| Place was used as a test to be able to convert the data retrieved from an image on the web and convert it into pixel objects to redisplay the image.

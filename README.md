# From-Beginning-To-Now
This repository will attempt to include all the code I've ever worked on from as far as I can.

## Notice
Due to fear of dangerous code that is probably somewhere on my computer that I coded, there will be some tags attached to some of the files.
### Places
Unnamed - Means that the name displayed is the actual original name of the script.

Filtered - Means that the place content was modified, most likely some content was removed.

Dead - Means that the place cannot be opened due to the fact that I: Tried to generate so many parts the place takes an undefined amount of time to load, tried to break the engine and did, too much data being loaded at once causes the program to crash or computer not strong enough to handle the file.

### Scripts
Unnamed - Means that the name displayed is the actual original name of the script.

Filtered - Means that the code content was modified, most likely removal of past databases and apis that are no longer active.

Modified - Code was not made from scratch and was instead modified, most likely used as theoretical testing purposes or personal use.

Team - Code was being worked on by more than one person, most likely a team rather than a community.

[aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.rbxl](https://github.com/alphafantomu/From-Beginning-To-Now/blob/master/RBXL%20Places/aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.rbxl) | Unnamed, Dead | Tuesday, June 19, 2018 3:55:09 PM | Honestly, for some reason I had no idea why I can't open the place, can't extract code from the place but may have been used for 3D Modeling.

[Packy Plugin.rbxl](https://github.com/alphafantomu/From-Beginning-To-Now/blob/master/RBXL%20Places/Packy%20Plugin.rbxl) | None | Sunday, July 15, 2018 5:01:10 PM | According to the repository the plugin was replicated on, "Packy is a Roblox Studio package manager. It is an alternative to Roblox's poor asset management system and offers lots of functionality and features to both developers and consumers alike. It is in development & hosted by https://bloxreport.com/code developers. It is also open-source so anyone and everyone can step in to see, modify, and even enhance our package fetcher.". Note this is no longer being updated by me and the website is inactive. Here's a link to it if you'd like to check it out if you can't access the file very well. https://github.com/alphafantomu/rbxpacky

[asdasdasdsada.rbxl](https://github.com/alphafantomu/From-Beginning-To-Now/blob/master/RBXL%20Places/asdasdasdsada.rbxl) | Unnamed | Monday, February 19, 2018, 9:17:58 PM | This place consists of a bunch of random code because super unorganized on where my code goes. This place includes code for: Function of uploading text files and view them raw using [Hastebin](https://hastebin.com)'s API. HTML Source stripper for all the object classes, properties, functions, yield functions, enumerations and the class system in the engine supplied by [Anaminus's API Reference](https://anaminus.github.io/api/), to be compressed into a database encoded in JSON. A client-sided script that was intentionally going to be a full-fledged project but was abandoned due to lack of motivation. Was supposed to be an Eclipsis multi-purpose exploit/hack/cheat, but never was stretched out. Another piece of code located in ServerStorage, it's an error-catching evaluated script that overrided Roblox's coding environment and rewritten yield calling and require methods to support instances with blank source strings and files across the web that are readable. This was most likely supposed to used as a multi-purpose hack/exploit/cheat for variety of games on Roblox, also has a whitelist system that checks the current logged in user in the browser through roblox's api. Lastly in Workspace, this is an admin script used to have control over other players in-game, specifically Script Builder games. Most of the code is in camel case, while I typically code pascal case this admin script was worked on by me and my partner, he coded camel case. Script has an hierachy class-based system with rankings, tabs that rotate the player, commands system, sandbox code to be run within the engine in-game, connection to http and able to modify other clients.

[AutoScriptSave.rbxl](https://github.com/alphafantomu/From-Beginning-To-Now/blob/master/RBXL%20Places/AutoScriptSave.rbxl) | Unnamed | Saturday, March 24, 2018, 5:22:23 PM | This is similar to the one above, it's a compilation of random coding projects that haven't been finished. This includes a client-script that automatically adjusts the distance of a line between two points, the points are able to be moved around and the line updates moves up to the amount of frames the program is running on, pretty neat, was actually planning to make it a module and use it to create real-time graph UIs based on gathered data. The code actually hasn't been updated for client-sided scripts, so running it in game will not correctly work. The gif below shows the line updating it's size and position every frame. There are two in-complete plugin scripts that were originally used to autosave. Specifically, my friend said that Roblox studio kept crashing on him and always lost all of his work, so I planned to design a plugin for him to automatically save all the scripts in the game into a webserver so that his code will be saved, however the project is incomplete. Also very blank-ish script that was originally intended to recreate LuaC functions inside Lua in-order to create a secondary lua interpreter inside lua in-order to bypass restrictions on engine coding. The autosave script also had an external support since there are script permissions within the engine, so this extension basically made it so that you'll be able to convert an instance back into XML data near perfectly and upload it to your inventory automatically, XML to Instance uses a json-compiled database of properties and instances. Lastly, we have a string to ascii encoder and decoder, simple enough turn a string into a string of bytes. Lastly I created my own numerical encryption using algebra 2 knowledge and properties of character bytes, encryption and decryption successful but there are round-off errors since it was used by a mathematical formula to be encrypted.

[ImageToPixel.rbxl](https://github.com/alphafantomu/From-Beginning-To-Now/blob/master/RBXL%20Places/ImageToPixel.rbxl) | None | Saturday, March 24, 2018, 5:22:23 PM | Quite small, tried to understand how images source data works with no outside knowledge, ended up converting the code to ascii bytes, back, conversions, in-order for it to get to an RGB format in pixels. Image showed to be a box with lines of colors. Other script is basically a source encryption with no key that loads through a Lua VM.

[FrameChangeTest.rbxl](https://github.com/alphafantomu/From-Beginning-To-Now/blob/master/RBXL%20Places/FrameChangeTest.rbxl) | None | Sunday, July 15, 2018, 6:57:18 PM | This place was used to find someway to thread the changing of colors to simulate changing frames by changing the rgb to ones of the next frame, tried making every pixel of a sample image a random color to test coloring speed. Sample image used was an image of Meliodas's Lostvayne weapon converted to pixels into the game.

[BaseplateIMGTEST.rbxl](https://github.com/alphafantomu/From-Beginning-To-Now/blob/master/RBXL%20Places/BaseplateIMGTEST.rbxl) | Dead | Tuesday, June 19, 2018 7:18:21 AM | The place literally was unable to load once I opened it, no idea what kind of content but I assume I tried to load an image clear 500,000 pixels or more into seperate instances, the engine apparently can't handle that, oof.

[BaseplateTETEtETETE](https://github.com/alphafantomu/From-Beginning-To-Now/blob/master/RBXL%20Places/BaseplateTETEtETETE_Modified.rbxl) | Filtered , Unnamed | Friday, June 22, 2018, 10:43:46 PM | Place used as a workspace of a project intended as a cheat script for a game. UI is inspired by Barry Allen's new tech suit after returning from the Speed Force.

[IMAGE COMPILATION.rbxl](https://github.com/alphafantomu/From-Beginning-To-Now/blob/master/RBXL%20Places/IMAGE%20COMPILATION.rbxl) | Unnamed, Dead | Monday, July 2, 2018, 5:13:05 AM | Used to compile an image's body data into pixels and recompile it as seperate pixels, the engine couldn't handle the result and then couldn't handle loading it. What a rip.

[ImageToPixel.rbxl](https://github.com/alphafantomu/From-Beginning-To-Now/blob/master/RBXL%20Places/ImageToPixel_Modified.rbxl) | Unnamed | Wednesday, April 11, 2018, 12:52:05 PM | Place was used as a test to be able to convert the data retrieved from an image on the web and convert it into pixel objects to redisplay the image.

[NewGameLike.rbxl](https://github.com/alphafantomu/From-Beginning-To-Now/blob/master/RBXL%20Places/NewGameLike.rbxl) | Unnamed | Thursday, July 26, 2018, 7:01:49 AM | This game I believe was intended to be a 3d-2d game with levels, story and a battle system, abandoned and unfinished but a more complete version is available on the published places section.

[NewPhotographicMemoryGame.rbxl](https://github.com/alphafantomu/From-Beginning-To-Now/blob/master/RBXL%20Places/NewPhotographicMemoryGame.rbxl) | Unnamed | Saturday, February 10, 2018, 12:30:33 AM | This game I believe was intended to be a 3d-2d game with levels, story and a battle system, abandoned and unfinished but a more complete version is available on the published places section.

[NewProject!!!.rbxl](https://github.com/alphafantomu/From-Beginning-To-Now/blob/master/RBXL%20Places/NewProject!!!_Modified.rbxl) | Unnamed, Filtered | Thursday, July 19, 2018, 1:56:04 AM | One of the first attempts at making a near perfect anti-exploit system for Roblox, unfinished and unpolished, has a circleClick function for UI effects, removed Encryption methods. 

[Noctis_Modified.rbxl](https://github.com/alphafantomu/From-Beginning-To-Now/blob/master/RBXL%20Places/Noctis_Modified.rbxl) | Unnamed, Filtered | Saturday, March 10, 2018, 6:22:56 PM | Place that was used as a cluster of random projects. Script named Boundless was a script that basically was going to allow you to modify any object regardless of any restrictions in the Engine. Pretty over powered but not finished. Has an Instance to XML data converter, works for objects that don't have data connected to the cloud servers. Has a script that allows you get all the information of every object in the engine available until up to a certain point, outdated. Pastebin module but was crushed in with a remote logger script?? Codes to rewrite the engine's coding environment with a custom user-created one. Noctis is a cheat-client-sided admin that was supposed to be advanced but never finished. For some reason Noctis has code that was used to answer if any numbers were "Quiteprime" or "Very Quiteprime" for a question that was on the PROMYS application for the summer when transitioning from Sophomore to Junior year. Lastly has code for exploit for custom functions, and connecting to external modules, rewritten require module to fix require etc.

[Packy_Plugin.rbxl](https://github.com/alphafantomu/From-Beginning-To-Now/blob/master/RBXL%20Places/Packy_Plugin.rbxl) | Unnamed | Sunday, July 15, 2018, 5:01:10 PM | Basically a plugin named Packy that was used to grab github repositories and convert them into roblox objects.

[PerfectDecompilerV4.rbxl](https://github.com/alphafantomu/From-Beginning-To-Now/blob/master/RBXL%20Places/PerfectDecompilerV4.rbxl) | Unnamed | Tuesday, December 26, 2017, 2:19:04 AM | This place contains the 4th person of my rbx instance decompiler (serializer) implemented into a plugin, it converts an instance to a dictionary and is able to convert a dictionary into an instance. Also has nevermore engine in here for some reason idk lmao. I advise you though if you were consider looking at the place file, opening the script "GET_PLACE" will lag very bad, it contains a json string that has an intense amount of characters that the engine has difficulty loading in a second.

[PhotographicMemoryGame.rbxl](https://github.com/alphafantomu/From-Beginning-To-Now/blob/master/RBXL%20Places/PhotographicMemoryGame.rbxl) | Unnamed | Friday, August 25, 2017, 12:03:26 AM | Basically a game designed to help develop perfect or near perfect photographic memory based on a taken down flash game on the web.

[PossibleRPGGame.rbxl](https://github.com/alphafantomu/From-Beginning-To-Now/blob/master/RBXL%20Places/PossibleRPGGame.rbxl) | Unnamed | Thursday, April 12, 2018, 12:46:58 AM | Looks like it was supposed to be a turn-based fantasy rpg game? But there's also a new encryption method encoded in Japanese character instead of english characters and a pokemon database of all the pokemon up to like 700+ and an html stripper to get all the pokemon data from pokeapi.co. Also has an anti-exploit system that's like definitely not finished.

[Proxy.rbxl](https://github.com/alphafantomu/From-Beginning-To-Now/blob/master/RBXL%20Places/Proxy_Modified.rbxl) | Friday, January 26, 2018, 7:38:52 PM | Filtered, Unnamed | Was supposed to be an rpg game, has an actual weapon and animations along with an old anti-exploit system with a encryption that has rounding error issues. Oof.

[SBTEST.rbxl](https://github.com/alphafantomu/From-Beginning-To-Now/blob/master/RBXL%20Places/SBTEST.rbxl) | Wednesday, May 30, 2018, 8:26:19 PM : Wednesday, May 30, 2018, 9:56:50 PM | Dead, Unnamed | Clicking the link will bring you to google, well this is because Github apparently only supports files lesser than 25 MB, and both the files, the autosave and the original are both like 30,723 KB and 46,546 KB. Probably because I attempted to make an infinitely perfect sphere or generated an image with a pixel area of like infinity or something, yeah I did some crazy stuff.

[ScriptBuilder.rbxl](https://github.com/alphafantomu/From-Beginning-To-Now/blob/master/RBXL%20Places/ScriptBuilder_Modified.rbxl) | Monday, July 30, 2018, 8:12:17 PM | Unnamed, Filtered | I had to remove uhhh, my discord bot credentials and roblox api logging in credentials that included the password soo uhhh, yeah. What remains is environment binding in Lua and Eclipsis Data grabber code for some cheat.

[Test.rbxl](https://github.com/alphafantomu/From-Beginning-To-Now/blob/master/RBXL%20Places/Test.rbxl) | Friday, April 13, 2018, 10:37:59 PM | Unnamed | Actually one of my more cooler projects, it's an attempt to make a character be blind but be able to see through the effects of sounds, tried to test vibrations and sound waves using a sphere having it's selection sphere instance expanded etc.

[TestingPlace.rbxl](https://github.com/alphafantomu/From-Beginning-To-Now/blob/master/RBXL%20Places/TestingPlace.rbxl) | Wednesday, July 4, 2018, 9:16:44 AM | Unnamed | File place is too big, big sad. But isn't dead surprisingly, the file contains gifs in pixel instances, that's why the file size is like 27,361 KB. 

[VAOS.rbxl](https://github.com/alphafantomu/From-Beginning-To-Now/blob/master/RBXL%20Places/VAOS_Modified.rbxl) | Saturday, April 28, 2018, 11:50:02 PM | Unnamed, Filtered | Actually tried to make an in-game operating system but got tired of it quickly.

[visit.rbxl](https://github.com/alphafantomu/From-Beginning-To-Now/blob/master/RBXL%20Places/visit.rbxl) | Saturday, April 28, 2018, 11:50:02 PM | Unnamed | Place file is way too big.

[Z2 Development.rbxl](https://github.com/alphafantomu/From-Beginning-To-Now/blob/master/RBXL%20Places/Z2%20Development_Modified.rbxl) | Tuesday, July 10, 2018, 7:27:48 AM | Unnamed, Filtered | Has server to client connection for exploits, uhhh. Also has gif loading, some cheat scripts, incomplete general cheat called Z2, standing for Zero Two from the anime, Darling in the Franxx. All past server-http urls, encryptions, passwords were removed.
